\section{Introduction}
\section{Methods}

The goal of this project is to add open boundary conditions (OBCs)
to MOM6 such that it can be used as a regional model. The open
boundaries can be placed anywhere on the model grid between q-points
on the Arakawa C grid, including but not limited to the domain
boundaries.  In fact, is is possible to create a staircase of open
boundary segments at an angle through the domain, such as seen in
figure \ref{fdomain}. In order to support this feature, it is
necessary that nothing outside of the open boundary is used in the
model timestepping. If halo points were used, then both segments 2
and 3 in Figure \ref{fhalo} would be trying to set properties at
point A.

\subsection{Barotropic}

\subsubsection{Specified}
For the barotropic mode, the only open boundary options are on the
velocity normal to a boundary segment. In the simplest case, one
knows both the barotropic velocity and the barotropic transport
through the OBC segments and can simply set them accordingly.

% Not sure what exact notation we want here.
\begin{equation}
  \overline{u}_{\rm seg} = \overline{u}
\end{equation}
